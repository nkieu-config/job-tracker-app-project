# Design system

Paper and ink: a warm paper ground, an ink primary, and a strict rule that
every remaining colour encodes a state rather than a brand. A Geist Sans /
Geist Mono / Literata trio where the mono tier is load-bearing, a tight radius
scale with no pills, and depth carried by hairline borders rather than shadows.

Two files are the source of truth:

- [`src/app/globals.css`](../src/app/globals.css) — the palette (light and dark),
  the `@theme` block (color, font, radius, type tokens), the display-type
  utilities, the focus ring, the entrance animation.
- [`src/components/ui/`](../src/components/ui/) — the primitives and class
  helpers every screen imports.

This document records the **rules and the reasoning**. Values live in the code
and are linked, not copied — a doc that mirrors implementation is a doc that
drifts, which is exactly how the previous version of this file ended up
describing a system that no longer existed.

## Overview

The ground is warm paper and the primary is ink (`--color-primary`) — a filled
button reads as printed type, not as a brand colour. The neutrals carry the same
warm bias, so nothing looks dropped onto the page.

The rule that drives everything: **the app has no decorative colour left.** Five
pipeline statuses, three semantic states, and the two marks the AI is allowed to
make have to stay distinguishable from each other, and that is the entire colour
budget. Anything spent on decoration is taken from the states that need it.

Typography is a **trio**, each tier answering "who produced this": Geist Sans for
interface, Geist Mono for what a machine computed, Literata for what reads as a
document — job descriptions, coaching briefs, interview questions. Buttons are
7px, cards 12px; nothing is a pill. Regions are separated by 1px hairlines and,
in dark mode, a real surface step.

### Key characteristics

- **Ink is the accent** — filled buttons, wordmark, active nav. Blue
  (`--color-link-blue`) is the only other chromatic note in body type, reserved
  for inline links.
- **Marker and pen are the AI's voice** — `--color-marker` highlights what the
  posting and your resume agree on; `--color-pen` underlines what is missing.
  They appear nowhere else, so seeing either one always means "the model marked
  this".
- **Mono as an information channel**, not decoration: it marks a value as
  computed and comparable.
- **A tight radius scale** (4–12px) assigned by role.
- **Borders, not shadows.** Shadow is reserved for things that genuinely float.
- **Indicators are dots**, so a dense list isn't a wall of tinted chips.
- **Dark mode is a palette swap**, not an inversion.
- **A categorical status palette** for the pipeline — five stages that must be
  distinguishable, never ranked by how "branded" they are.

## Color

All tokens are `--color-*` properties in the `@theme` block, fed by raw
properties the dark palette redefines. See
[`globals.css`](../src/app/globals.css) for the values.

| Group | Tokens | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brand | `primary`, `primary-press`, `on-primary` | Filled buttons, wordmark, active nav, accent text — ink, not a hue |
| AI | `marker`, `marker-ink`, `pen` | The only marks the model may make on a document: highlight for a match, underline for a gap |
| Link | `link-blue`, `link-hover` | Inline links — the only chromatic note in body text |
| Surface | `canvas`, `canvas-lavender`, `canvas-lavender-hover`, `surface-hover` | `canvas` is the card; `canvas-lavender` is the page beneath it (named for the retired palette — renamed when the components move) |
| Line | `hairline` | 1px borders and dividers — the workhorse |
| Text | `ink`, `ink-mute` | Body and secondary; `ink` is also the focus ring |
| Semantic | `semantic-{error,success,warning}` + `-tint` | Status feedback, never decoration |

Two values worth knowing the reasoning for:

- **The dark primary is lightened.** It has to clear 4.5:1 under white button
  text *and* stay legible as accent text on a near-black page — one token, two
  jobs.
- **The light warning is a dark amber, not a bright one.** It appears as 12–13px
  text, and badge text is never "large text" under WCAG.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`canvas-lavender` inverts its relationship to `canvas` between themes.** On
> light it is the paper *under* white cards; on dark it is the page *under*
> lighter cards. So a chip filled with it lifts on light and sinks on dark.
> Anything that must read as raised in both themes tints with the accent
> (`bg-primary/15`) instead. This is exactly the bug that hid the landing's
> feature-icon chips in dark mode.

### Pipeline status — a categorical scale

The five stages need colours that read as *different*, not as *more or less
branded*, so they come from Tailwind's palette rather than the ink system.
[`status-colors.ts`](../src/components/ui/status-colors.ts) is the single source:
one entry per status supplying every surface it appears on (`badge`, `dot`,
`fill`, `num`, `seg`), each with a dark variant.

`SAVED` zinc · `APPLIED` blue · `INTERVIEW` amber · `OFFER` green · `REJECTED` red

This is the system's one sanctioned break from the single-accent rule — see
[Deliberate departures](#deliberate-departures).

### Dark mode

Dark is a **redefinition of the raw custom properties**, not `dark:` classes
scattered through components. Three pieces make it work:

1. **Token indirection.** `@theme inline` maps `--color-*` to `var(--*)` rather
   than to literal hex. This matters: with a literal, Tailwind bakes the value
   into the generated utility and no re-declaring can flip it.
2. **A variant that honours both signals.** `@custom-variant dark` matches
   `[data-theme="dark"]` *or* `prefers-color-scheme: dark` when no theme is set,
   so the OS preference works and the in-app toggle wins when used.
3. **A pre-paint script** in [`layout.tsx`](../src/app/layout.tsx) stamps
   `data-theme` before first paint, so there is no flash.

Components reference tokens and the palette does the rest. The exception is
`STATUS_COLORS`, which uses Tailwind palette classes and spells its dark
variants out.

## Typography

Geist Sans (`--font-sans`) and Geist Mono (`--font-mono`) via the `geist`
package, plus Literata (`--font-serif`) via `next/font/google` — all loaded in
[`layout.tsx`](../src/app/layout.tsx). Literata is the document tier: it sets
the text the app did not write, so a job posting never looks like interface.

**Display tier** — `font-display-lg` (50px) / `-md` (32px, the workhorse) /
`-sm` (24px). Implemented as `@utility` classes rather than `@theme` variables so
each bundles size, weight, leading and tracking: a headline can never be set at
default tracking by accident.

**UI tier** — `--text-title` (18px) / `-body-lg` (16) / `-body` (14) /
`-caption` (13) / `-fine` (12). Denser than a marketing scale, because app chrome
carries more per screen than a landing page.

**Mono tier** — no size scale of its own; it borrows the UI tier and is applied
with `font-mono`. It is a channel, not a hierarchy.

| Mono | Sans |
| --- | --- |
| Dates, deadlines, percentages, scores | Prose, labels, headings, button text |
| Counts, statistics, token/latency/cost | |
| Identifiers, filenames, error digests | |

`Added` stays sans while the date beside it goes mono — the word is prose, the
value is data. Pair `tabular-nums` with mono wherever values stack in a column.

### Principles

- **Tight tracking on display.** Negative letter-spacing across 24–50px; without
  it the headlines read loose and unedited.
- **Mono means "measured".** If a human wrote it, sans. If the system computed
  it, mono.
- **Reach for a `--text-*` token,** never `text-sm` / `text-xs`.

## Layout & spacing

Tailwind's default 4px scale; the app defines no spacing tokens. Cards are `p-8`
(compact ones `p-6`). The landing bands run `py-16 md:py-24`. The application
detail page separates sections with `divide-y divide-hairline` rather than
wrapping each in a card.

## Elevation & depth

Border first, surface step second, shadow only when something genuinely floats.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Flat on `canvas-lavender` | The page |
| 1 | `border-hairline` + `bg-canvas` | Cards, rows, panels — the default |
| 2 | Soft ink shadow | The landing's product panel and fit console |
| 3 | Stronger shadow | Drag overlay, dialogs — actually lifted |

In dark mode the border does less work and the surface step does more: the page
is darker than the card, so cards read as raised even where a hairline is nearly
invisible.

## Shape

The radius scale is redefined in `@theme`, overriding Tailwind's defaults. There
is no pill token.

| Class | Radius | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rounded-sm` | 4px | Form inputs |
| `rounded-md` | 6px | Badges, chips, segmented segments, logo tiles, icon-only affordances |
| `rounded-lg` | 7px | **Buttons**, banners, icon chips, compact cards |
| `rounded-xl` | 9px | Board cards and troughs, fit rows, unlock boxes |
| `rounded-2xl` | 12px | Standard cards, the list table, landing panels |
| `rounded-full` | ∞ | Dots and bar fills — things that are actually round |

- **Nesting steps down.** An inner radius always sits one step below its
  container: a `rounded-lg` segmented control holds `rounded-md` segments.
- **`rounded-full` is geometry, not style.** A status dot is round because it is
  a dot. Nothing with a text label is round any more.

## Motion

`--animate-rise` (0.5s, used by the dashboard pipeline cards) and `.reveal`, a
scroll-triggered fade on the landing only
([`reveal.tsx`](../src/components/ui/reveal.tsx)). Reveal **opts out entirely**
under `prefers-reduced-motion` — it never sets the hidden state, so content is
visible immediately rather than animating quickly. A global rule flattens every
animation, transition and smooth scroll under the same query.

## Components

Every primitive lives in [`src/components/ui/`](../src/components/ui/) and is the
only place its thing is styled. Classes are not reproduced here — read the file.

| Primitive | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`button.tsx`](../src/components/ui/button.tsx) | `rounded-lg`, six variants (primary / secondary / outline / ghost / danger / danger-solid), three sizes. `md` and `lg` land at ~42px and ~52px tall |
| [`card.tsx`](../src/components/ui/card.tsx) | `rounded-2xl` + hairline; padding passed by the caller |
| [`empty-state.tsx`](../src/components/ui/empty-state.tsx) | The same shape, dashed, with icon / title / body / CTA slots |
| [`form-styles.ts`](../src/components/ui/form-styles.ts) | `inputClass` + `labelClass`. Every form imports both — a field styled by hand is a bug |
| [`badge.tsx`](../src/components/ui/badge.tsx) | `Badge` (a `rounded-md` tint, for **tags only**) and `Dot` |
| [`status-badge.tsx`](../src/components/applications/status-badge.tsx) | A `STATUS_COLORS` dot plus the status label |
| [`segmented-control.tsx`](../src/components/ui/segmented-control.tsx) | `rounded-lg` shell, `rounded-md` segments; `filterChipClass` follows the same logic standalone |
| [`section-nav.tsx`](../src/components/applications/section-nav.tsx) | The detail page's scroll-spy rail, `lg` and up |

Inline messages share one shape — `rounded-lg` with a semantic surface; errors
carry `role="alert"`, status messages `role="status"`.

### Indicators — dots, not pills

The signature move. A tinted pill per row turns a dense list into confetti, so
state is carried by a 6px dot beside neutral text: the colour identifies, the
text says it out loud. `Dot` is always `aria-hidden` — it is never the only
carrier of meaning. Fit pairs a `Dot` toned by `fitBand()` with the score in
mono; band and number travel together.

`Badge` survives for genuine tags — skill chips, "Best fit" — but no longer
carries status and is no longer a pill.

### Deadline tone

Urgency is honest or it is noise. `deadlineTone()`
([`format.ts`](../src/lib/format.ts)) buckets a date and
[`deadline.ts`](../src/components/ui/deadline.ts) maps it to one class:

| Tone | When | Reads as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `overdue` | before today | error, semibold |
| `soon` | within 3 days | warning |
| `upcoming` | later | muted |

Every deadline in the app imports this map, so a date can't be red on one screen
and grey on another. A date that is merely *present* is never coloured.

### Focus ring

A system-wide rule in `globals.css`: a 2px `ink` outline, offset, with a `canvas`
halo. A `currentColor` ring would vanish into ink-filled buttons; an ink ring
separated by a paper halo stays visible on the page, on cards, on filled
buttons and in dark mode alike.

## Responsive behavior

Tailwind's default breakpoints. The three patterns that matter:

- **The board becomes an accordion.** Below `lg` the columns stack full-width,
  each header collapsing its cards; from `lg` they are side-by-side columns and
  the header is inert. Every section auto-expands while a card is dragged, so a
  collapsed stage never stops being a drop target.
- **The list table keeps all three columns.** Below `sm` the status and deadline
  columns narrow and the role truncates, rather than forcing a horizontal scroll
  that would push the deadline off-screen.
- **The detail page collapses its rail.** From `lg` it is a sticky facts +
  on-this-page rail beside the content; below that the facts stack on top and the
  scroll-spy nav hides.

**Touch targets.** `md` buttons land at ~42px, `lg` at ~52px, fields at ~44px —
at or above the 44×44 target of WCAG 2.5.5. Button padding is not a free
parameter.

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do** — reserve ink fills for buttons, the wordmark and active nav (one filled
button per viewport) · reserve `marker`/`pen` for marks the model made · set
document text in `font-serif` · set computed values in `font-mono` with
`tabular-nums` · set headlines with a `font-display-*` utility · import the
primitives rather than restyling · take pipeline colours from `STATUS_COLORS` ·
tint with `bg-primary/15` when a surface must read as raised in both themes.

**Don't** — add a decorative colour family · use `marker` or `pen` for anything
a human wrote · use ink fills for body text · reach for
`rounded-full` on anything with a text label · set prose in mono or a computed
value in sans · colour a deadline by hand · fill a status pill where a dot will
do · assume `canvas-lavender` lifts (it inverts) · write a `dark:` class where a
token would flip on its own · reach for a shadow where a hairline will do.

## Deliberate departures

Where the system diverges from the marketing language it started in. These are
choices, not drift:

| Departure | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **The 90px pill was removed entirely** | A marketing page has a handful of CTAs; this app has buttons, chips, segments and toggles on every screen. At that density uniform pills stop reading as emphasis and start reading as a default — nothing has a stance. 7px lets shape carry role again. |
| **A mono tier was added** | A tracker is mostly numbers. One family gives the reader no way to tell a computed value from a written one; mono is the cheapest possible signal. |
| **The pastel-mesh gradient was dropped** | It carried depth for a page with almost nothing on it. Behind a real board it fought the cards, and it has no honest dark-mode analogue. |
| **Neutrals were biased toward the accent** | Pure greys made the ink look pasted on. |
| **Status pills became dots** | Fine on a marketing card, unreadable on a 12-row table. |
| **A categorical status palette** breaks the "never add a third accent" rule | Five stages must be *distinguishable*, not *branded*. Ranking them by how close to ink they are would encode a meaning the data doesn't have. Confined to `STATUS_COLORS`, so it can't leak into brand surfaces. |
| **Dark mode as a palette swap** rather than `dark:` classes | Scattering overrides through components makes the palette unknowable. |
| **A focus-ring rule was added** | The source never contended with ink-filled buttons, where a `currentColor` ring disappears. |

## Provenance

This system began as an adaptation of a design-language study of a Slack-inspired
marketing site: the aubergine palette, the lavender canvases, the 90px pill, the
pastel-mesh gradient and the display-typography rules came from there, with
**Inter** substituted for the study's two proprietary faces.

It has since been rebuilt twice. The marketing language was doing what it was
designed to do — sell on a page with three CTAs and a lot of air — and that is
the wrong job for a board, a table, and a detail page with six sections.

The second rebuild retired the aubergine itself. Counting what the palette
actually had to encode — five pipeline statuses, three semantic states, and the
marks the AI makes on a posting — showed the brand hue was spending colour the
states needed, and that a purple-accented AI product looks like every other one.
Paper and ink freed the whole chromatic range for meaning. What survived from
the original study is only the display tier's tight tracking.
